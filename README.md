# React Hooks Practice 

This repo is my learning space to better understand **React’s functional patterns**, **state management**, and **modern component architecture**.  
It also serves as an educational reference: documenting *what hooks are*, *why they were introduced*, and *how they transformed React development*.

## 📜 What Are React Hooks?

React Hooks are built-in functions that let you “hook into” React features using **functional components**.  
Before hooks existed, stateful logic and side effects were only possible in **class components**. Hooks brought these capabilities to functions, making React simpler, more expressive, and easier to reuse.

Common hooks include:

- `useState` – State management  
- `useEffect` – Side effects (fetching, subscriptions, timers)  
- `useContext` – Shared/global state  
- `useReducer` – Advanced or centralized state logic  
- `useRef` – Mutable values & DOM references  
- `useMemo` / `useCallback` – Performance optimization  
- `Custom Hooks`– Reusable logic extracted from components

## 🕰️ A Brief History of Hooks

- **2013–2018:** React relied heavily on **class components** for handling state and lifecycle events.  
- **Challenges:**
  - Logic split across lifecycle methods made components harder to follow  
  - Reusing logic required HOCs or render props, adding complexity  
  - Classes caused issues with `this` binding and lifecycle timing  
- **2018 (React 16.8):** Hooks were introduced  
- **Impact:** Functional components gained full access to state and side effects, reducing the need for classes and simplifying the mental model.  
- **Today:** Hooks are the preferred pattern for modern React development.

## ❓ Why Do We Need Hooks?

### ✔ 1. Cleaner, simpler components  
Hooks allow state and effects directly in function components without complex class syntax.

### ✔ 2. Better logic reuse  
Custom hooks enable extracting stateful logic without HOCs or render props.

### ✔ 3. Improved code organization  
Related logic stays together (e.g., fetching + cleanup) instead of being scattered across lifecycle methods.

### ✔ 4. More predictable behavior  
No more dealing with `this`, class quirks, or confusing lifecycle order.

### ✔ 5. Performance improvements  
Memoization hooks like `useMemo` and `useCallback` help control unnecessary re-renders.
